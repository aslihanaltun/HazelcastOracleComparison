# HazelcastOracleComparison
# Hazelcast vs. Oracle SQL Execution Time Comparison

## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to compare the execution time of data processing using Hazelcast IMDG and Oracle SQL. We will be inserting and retrieving random numbers with varying data sizes and recording the time taken for each operation. This comparison will help us understand the basic differences between Hazelcast and Oracle SQL data processing.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a machine or server where you can install and run Hazelcast IMDG and Oracle SQL.
- Appropriate permissions to perform installation and testing.

## Instructions

### 1. Installing Hazelcast IMDG

- Follow the official Hazelcast installation guide to install Hazelcast IMDG on your machine or server.
- Note down the installation steps and any configurations you make during the process.

### 2. Inserting and Retrieving Random Numbers

#### Step 1: 20,000 Random Numbers

- Generate 20,000 random numbers and insert them into Hazelcast IMDG and Oracle SQL respectively.
- Record the time taken for the insertion process for both Hazelcast and Oracle SQL.

#### Step 2: Retrieving 20,000 Random Numbers

- Randomly retrieve the 20,000 numbers from both Hazelcast and Oracle SQL.
- Record the time taken for the retrieval process for both Hazelcast and Oracle SQL.

#### Step 3: 100,000 Random Numbers

- Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 100,000 random numbers.
- Record the time taken for the insertion and retrieval processes for both Hazelcast and Oracle SQL.

### 3. Comparison Results
